The fixtures in this directory are encoded in various formats to test the encoding detection and decoding capabilities of Whiskers.

Some text editors like to normalize the encoding of files when saving them. Please be careful not to change them unintentionally.

There are tests in `tests/encodings.rs` that ensure these fixtures are not unintentionally changed.
